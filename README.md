## üöÄ Features

* **Automatic Site Analysis (Agent 1):** The first time you use PromptGod on a new AI website (like RunwayML, Midjourney, etc.), it analyzes the site to understand its generative AI capabilities and saves this "map" for future use.
* **Context-Aware Function Selection:** The UI dynamically displays the specific AI functions available on the current site, allowing you to choose the one you're using (e.g., "Text to Image", "Code Generation").
* **Expert Rule Generation (Agent 2):** For each function on a site, PromptGod researches and generates a master "system prompt" detailing the best practices, keywords, and structures for optimal results. This is cached for efficiency.
* **Intelligent Prompt Enhancement (Agent 3):** Your simple prompt is intelligently rewritten and optimized based on the expert rules, transforming it into a detailed, high-quality prompt.
* **Sleek, Modern UI:** A user-friendly, non-intrusive modal with a frosted glass effect and smooth animations makes the experience seamless.
* **Built-in History:** Automatically saves your original and enhanced prompts to your browser's local storage. Your history is fully searchable and filterable by function.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
* [Python 3.9+](https://www.python.org/)
* [Google Cloud SDK (gcloud CLI)](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install)
* [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)

### Part 1: Firebase Setup (The Database)
PromptGod uses Firestore for its database. The free "Spark Plan" is more than enough.

1.  Go to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
2.  Click **"Add project"** and select your existing Google Cloud Project (or create a new one).
3.  In the Firebase Console, navigate to **Build > Firestore Database**.
4.  Click **"Create database"**.
5.  Select **Start in production mode** and choose a region for your database.
6.  Click **Enable**. Your database is now ready.

### Part 2: Local Backend Setup (For Development)
These steps will get the Python backend running on your local machine.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone <your-repo-url>
    cd promptgod/backend
    ```

2.  **Get Service Account Credentials:**
    * To allow your local server to talk to Firestore, you need a service account key.
    * Follow the instructions in the [Google Cloud documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/keys-create-delete#creating) to create a key for a service account.
    * Download the JSON file, rename it to `key.json`, and place it inside the `backend` folder.

3.  **Run the Setup Script:**
    * Double-click the `setup.bat` script.
    * This will automatically create a Python virtual environment and install all required dependencies.

4.  **Run the Local Server:**
    * Double-click the `run.bat` script.
    * This will activate the environment and start the Flask server at `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.

### Part 3: Chrome Extension Setup (For Development)
1.  **Configure the URL:**
    * Open `chrome-extension/background.js`.
    * Make sure the `BACKEND_URL` constant is set to your local server: `const BACKEND_URL = 'http://127.0.0.1:5000';`.

2.  **Load the Extension:**
    * Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions`.
    * Enable **"Developer mode"** in the top-right corner.
    * Click **"Load unpacked"** and select the `chrome-extension` folder.

3.  **Set Your API Key:**
    * Find the PromptGod extension in your extensions list and click on its "Options".
    * Enter your Google Gemini API Key and select your preferred model.

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Deployment to Google Cloud Run

### Part 1: Prepare the Backend Code
For deployment, your code authenticates automatically and doesn't need the `key.json` file. Ensure your `main.py` uses the standard, environment-aware client initialization.

* Open `backend/main.py` and make sure the Firestore initialization block looks like this:
    ```python
    # Environment-aware client for production
    try:
        db = firestore.Client()
        print("‚úÖ Firestore client initialized successfully!")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"‚ùå FATAL ERROR: Could not initialize Firestore client: {e}")
        db = None
    ```

### Part 2: Deploy
1.  Open a terminal and navigate to the `backend` directory.
2.  Set your gcloud project:
    ```sh
    gcloud config set project YOUR_PROJECT_ID
    ```
3.  Run the deployment command:
    ```sh
    gcloud run deploy promptgod-service --source . --platform managed --region us-central1 --allow-unauthenticated
    ```
    * This command builds your container, pushes it to the registry, and deploys it to Cloud Run.
    * When finished, it will give you a **Service URL**. Copy this URL.

### Part 3: Configure the Deployed Extension
1.  Go back to `chrome-extension/background.js`.
2.  Change the `BACKEND_URL` constant to your new Cloud Run **Service URL**.
    ```javascript
    const BACKEND_URL = '[https://promptgod-service-xxxxxxxxxx-uc.a.run.app](https://promptgod-service-xxxxxxxxxx-uc.a.run.app)';
    ```
3.  Go to `chrome://extensions` and click the "Reload" button for your PromptGod extension.

Your extension is now fully deployed and running in the clou
